"""
Minor Sphinx extension for counting the number of lines in a file.

:linecount:`../relative/path/to/file.txt` will be replaced with the number of lines in `file.txt`.

Paths should be relative to the directory of the current file, not the source directory.
This is the same  path passed to literalinclude.
