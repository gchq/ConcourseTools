"""
The Concourse web UI will interpret :wikipedia:`ANSI colour codes <ANSI_escape_code#Colors>`,
and so a handful of rudimentary functions for formatting with colour are include in
:mod:`concoursetools.colour`.

.. tip::
    There are plenty of more mature libraries for printing coloured output,
    such as `termcolor <https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/>`_ and
    `Rich <https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/console.html#color-systems>`_.
    Concourse Tools specifically has no external dependencies, and so these
    must be actively installed and managed by a user.
